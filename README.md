## Overview

**Respansive** is a responsive web design project aimed at providing a dynamic user experience across various screen sizes. It uses HTML, CSS, and responsive design techniques to ensure the website looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project is part of a portfolio to showcase my skills in front-end development, particularly focusing on responsive design.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sajjad-sisakhtpour/respansive.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd respansive
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser to view the project locally.

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can view the responsive layout by resizing your browser window or viewing it on different devices.

- **Desktop View**: Displays the full navigation and content in a two-column layout.
- **Mobile View**: Adjusts the layout to a single-column format, hides the menu, and stacks content vertically.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how the layout adapts to different screen sizes:

- On larger screens (desktops), the navigation and content are displayed side by side.
- On smaller screens (tablets and phones), the content reflows into a more vertical layout with simplified navigation.
